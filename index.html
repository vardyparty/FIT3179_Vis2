  <h1> Venues and Attendances in the Australian Football League, in the AFL Era (2012-present) </h1>
<h2> Which Games Draw The Largest Attendances? </h2>

<p class="left-para">Some of the most attended matches feature Melburnian teams, with local rivalries 
  and capacious stadiums setting the scene for spectators to descend upon football heartland by the thousands. 
  While Melburnian teams, such as Collingwood, Melbourne, and Richmond tend to draw large crowds, signalled by dark blue gradients, emerging teams such as 
  Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney struggle to attract many spectators, especially at home. This is indicated by numerous 
  squares with lighter blue gradients. Note: as the MCG, a Melbourne stadium, is the only >60 thousand capacity stadium in Australia 
  regularly hosting Australian Football matches, it becomes difficult for interstate clubs to draw crowds in excess of 60 thousand.
  However, as future diagrams will show, having a large stadium capacity does not guarantee a relatively large turnout.</p>

<h2> How are Games Distributed Around Australia? </h2>

<p class="right-para"> As per <a href = https://twitter.com/sirswampthing/status/1255687883010142210> SirSwampThing</a>, Matthew 
Pavlich is the most-travelled AFL player - his 2016 season journey is visualised as the black lines on the map to the right. Since 2012, 
games in the Australian Football League (AFL) has been played all around the country, from Darwin to Hobart, and from Perth to 
Townsville. Despite this, the main trend that AFL fixturing follows favours the major cities - after all, they are  where teams' 
home matches are predominantly played, with venues in other towns only seeing the occasional match. These may be annual matches, 
such as Melbourne's annual game at TIO Stadium, Alice Springs, or matches due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the large number 
of games played at Cairns' Cazaly Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions. </p>

<h2> How Well do Cities Attend AFL Games, Proportional to Stadium Capacity and City Population?</h2>

<p class="left-para"> Through selecting a year on the left, major cities can be compared to each other, and across years, based on 
average attendances against stadium capacity and the city's population. While the proportional symbol map and the heatmap both showed
the dominance of Melbourne as a city in terms of drawing crowds, a different picture is painted here - in most years, it has a relatively
low number of attendees per capita. Conversely, Geelong, courtesy of its lower population, has regularly large values for this statistic,
while Perth patrons regularly fill their stadiums up the most. (The 2023 drop may be due to the poor form of both WA-based teams, the 
Fremantle Dockers and West Coast Eagles.) </div>
