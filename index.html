  <h1> Venues and Attendances in the Australian Football League in the AFL Era (2012-present) </h1>
<h2> Which Games Draw the Largest Attendances? </h2>
<div class="pure-g">

<p class="right-para">Some of the most attended matches feature Melburnian teams, with local rivalries 
  and capacious stadiums setting the scene for spectators to descend upon football heartland by the thousands. 
  While Melburnian teams, such as Collingwood, Melbourne, and Richmond tend to draw large crowds, signalled by dark blue gradients, emerging teams such as 
  Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney struggle to attract many spectators, especially at home. This is indicated by numerous 
  squares with lighter blue gradients. Note: as the MCG, a Melbourne stadium, is the only >60 thousand capacity stadium in Australia 
  regularly hosting Australian Football matches, it becomes difficult for interstate clubs to draw crowds in excess of 60 thousand.
  However, as future diagrams will show, having a large stadium capacity does not guarantee a relatively large turnout.</p>

<h2> How are Games Distributed Around Australia? </h2>
<div class="pure-g">

<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div>
<p class="left-para"> As per <a href = https://twitter.com/sirswampthing/status/1255687883010142210> SirSwampThing</a>, Matthew 
Pavlich is the most-travelled AFL player - his 2016 season journey is visualised as the black lines on the map to the right. Since 2012, 
games in the Australian Football League (AFL) has been played all around the country, from Darwin to Hobart, and from Perth to 
Townsville. Despite this, the main trend that AFL fixturing follows favours the major cities - after all, they are  where teams' 
home matches are predominantly played, with venues in other towns only seeing the occasional match. These may be annual matches, 
such as Melbourne's annual game at TIO Stadium, Alice Springs, or matches due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the large number 
of games played at Cairns' Cazaly Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions. </p>

<h2> How Well do Cities Attend AFL Games, Proportional to Stadium Capacity and City Population?</h2>
<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div id="vis3" class="vis"></div>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div>
<p class="right-para"> Through selecting a year on the left, major cities can be compared to each other, and across years, based on 
average attendances against stadium capacity and the city's population. While the proportional symbol map and the heatmap both showed
the dominance of Melbourne as a city in terms of drawing crowds, a different picture is painted here - in most years, it has a relatively
low number of attendees per capita. Conversely, Geelong, courtesy of its lower population, has regularly large values for this statistic,
while Perth patrons regularly fill their stadiums up the most. (The 2023 dropoff may be due to the poor form of both WA-based teams, the 
Fremantle Dockers and West Coast Eagles.) This chart also puts into perspective the lack of relative support for Australian football in Sydney,
despite their moderate attendances when using absolute values </div>

</div>

<h2> How Did Attendances Change During COVID-19?</h2>
<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div>
<p class="left-para"> From a sporting context, the impact of COVID-19 is most easily portrayed through the drastic change in attendances from before 2020, to the 2020 season, and the seasons succeeding this.
While the line graph to the right uses individual years as data points, interpolation allows for the hypothetical simulation of attendance progression as restrictions were brought in and taken away.
While the most evident aspect of the average attendance figures is the severe drop off for 2020 values, it must be noted that the gradients before and after these minumum points are not equal, with stadium restrictions 
in 2021 being lifted slowly and steadily. The chart also demonstrates that the Gabba was the venue least affected by COVID-19 restrictions in terms of attendances, still maintaining an average of >5000 patrons and 
filling over 18% of available seating, on average. </p>

<h2> Have Attendances Increased From the Start of the AFL Era, to the Present? </h2>
<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div id="vis5" class="vis"></div>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<div>
<p class="right-para"> As this bar chart relies on only two individual datapoints per city, it is limited in its ability to explain variability, and may be influenced by a multitude of extraneous variables.
However, the general trend remains, with average attendances rising across every major city as expected. Coupling this data with the normalised scatterplot, it can be inferred that football in Brisbane has 
especially come to prominence from 2012 to 2023 - a potential explanation for this may be the turnaround in form of the only Brisbane team, the Brisbane Lions. Coversely, while Perth has also had a considerable jump in attendees,
this is not reflected in the normalised attendance values - this may be due to the opening of the high-capacity Optus Stadium in 2018. While earlier, it was seen that Australian football had a low popularity in Sydney, this chart displays that popularity is growing at a fast pace. </div>

<h2> How Dispersed are Attendance Figures for Different Grounds? </h2>
<div id="vis6" class="central-vis"></div>
<p class="central-para"> Holistically, analysing the binned distribution of attendances per individual reveals some important lessons. Instantly, variability across different grounds can be pinpointed, 
with the Melbourne Cricket Ground being host to a broad variety of crowd sizes, compared to the relatively homogenous attendance numbers of the University of Tasmania Stadium. Clusters can also be identified, 
such as the many games at Marvel Stadium with crowds between ~24000 and ~36000. Outliers can also be easily spotted, such as the crowds at, or close to, zero for some stadiums - all occuring during 2020 or 2021. Of the venues that
had crowds at or close to zero, it can be noticed that Heritage Bank Stadium has a high proportion of these values compared to its other attendance figures - this may be due to its use as a COVID-19 hub during the 2020 season.</p>
