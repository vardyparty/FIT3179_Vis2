<p class="left-para">Some of the most attended matches feature Melburnian teams, with local rivalries, clashes with history, 
  and big capacity stadiums setting the scene for spectators to descend upon football heartland by the thousands. 
  Annual games such as the ANZAC day match between Collingwood and Essendon, and the Good Friday Superclash between 
  North Melbourne and Carlton - regularly draw in excess of 30 thousand attendees. While Melburnian teams, such as 
  Collingwood, Melbourne, and Richmond tend to draw large crowds, signalled by dark blue gradients, emerging teams such as 
  Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney struggle to attract many spectators, especially at home. This is indicated by numerous 
  squares with lighter blue gradients. Note: as the MCG, a Melbourne stadium, is the only >60 thousand capacity stadium in Australia 
  regularly hosting Australian Football matches, it becomes difficult for interstate clubs to draw crowds in excess of 60 thousand.
  However, as future diagrams will show, having a large stadium capacity does not guarantee a relatively large turnout.</p>

<p class="right-para"> As per <a href = https://twitter.com/sirswampthing/status/1255687883010142210> SirSwampThing </a>, Matthew 
Pavlich is the most-travelled AFL player - his 2016 season is visualised as the black line on the map to the right. Since 2012, 
games in the Australian Football League (AFL) has been played all around the country, from Darwin to Hobart, and from Perth to 
Townsville. Despite this, the main trend that AFL fixturing follows favours the major cities - after all, they are  where teams' 
home matches are predominantly played, with venues in other towns only seeing the occasional match. These may be annual matches, 
such as Melbourne's annual game at TIO Stadium, Alice Springs, or matches due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the large number 
of games played at Cairns' Cazaly Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
