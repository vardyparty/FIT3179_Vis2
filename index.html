  <p> Ben McKay to depart
 
North Melbourne has decided not to match the offer made by Essendon to restricted free agent Ben McKay.
 
North Melbourne will receive Band 1 compensation for the departing McKay, meaning the Roos have AFL Draft selection No.3 to add to the second overall pick in this year’s AFL Draft. 
 
The Roos now hold draft selection Nos. 2, 3, 15 and 21 – as well as two third-round picks – with a week remaining in the Continental Tyres AFL Trade Period. 
 
McKay arrived at Arden Street at selection No.21 in the 2015 AFL Draft and has played 71 games since making his debut in Round 23, 2017. 
 
North Melbourne general manager of football Todd Viney acknowledged McKay’s contribution to the club over the past eight years. 
 
“We understand that free agency is part of football, and after consideration, ultimately decided it was in the best interests of the club not to match the offer presented to Ben,” he said.
 
“Right now, that gives us two picks at the top end of the draft. That’s similar to last year when we were able to take Harry Sheezel and George Wardlaw with two really early picks.
 
“Making the call on allowing Ben to leave was a tough one. He’s made a significant contribution during his time at the club as a key part of our defence and, more recently, a member of the leadership group.
 
“We respect his decision to exercise his free agency rights and wish him the best in his next chapter.”

  <p> Dear Danny,
Re-enrolment for 2024 is now open!

You need to re-enrol in your 2024 units or apply for intermission by 11.59pm (AEDT) on Friday 24 November to avoid a $348 late fee. 

If you have an encumbrance, you’ll need to clear it before re-enrolling (check if you have an encumbrance). If you plan to complete your course this year, you won’t need to re-enrol but you’ll still need to clear your encumbrance to apply to graduate.
How to re-enrol
Check your course requirements (core and elective) by referring to the archived handbook for the year that you started your course. 
Use the 2024 handbook to choose units for the whole year that meet your course requirements. Enrol for the whole year unless you’re completing your course mid-year or have an approved exception.
Log into the Web Enrolment System (WES) and enrol in your 2024 units – if you’re in a double degree, you’ll need to re-enrol for both course components.
Receive a confirmation email that includes your U transaction number so you know you’ve successfully re-enrolled. 
If you don’t re-enrol, you risk losing your place in your course and your Commonwealth Supported Place (if you’re a CSP student). If you’re not sure about studying in 2024, contact Monash Connect to discuss your options. 
Key points to remember
Don’t wait – you can change your mind (and your units) later
You should re-enrol as soon as possible. Don’t wait for your results to re-enrol – when selecting units, assume you've met the prerequisite requirements for any units with outstanding results. You can easily add, discontinue or change units later. 

Unit attendance modes
Each unit has a unit attendance mode listed in the Handbook and WES that describe how the teaching activities are delivered, such as on-campus or flexible mode. Learn more about the different unit attendance modes.

International students on a student visa: study load and attendance mode requirements
If you're on a student visa, as a condition of your visa you must:
enrol in a full-time study load (24 credit points per semester or 48 credit points per year) 
enrol primarily in on-campus or flexible mode units during your course 
not exceed one third of your course completed in online study mode
for each teaching period, enrol in at least one on-campus or flexible mode unit.
Intermission, course transfers and re-enrolment conditions
Most students need to re-enrol to keep their place at Monash, even if they’re on intermission, applying for a course transfer or have re-enrolment conditions. If you’re not sure if you need to re-enrol, check the re-enrolment conditions. 
More information

For other enquiries, Monash Connect can help. You can also chat with us.
Kind regards,
